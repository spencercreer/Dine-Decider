# Decider Diner
A web application that helps you decide what to eat!
Not sure what you want to eat? Not a problem!
The Decider Diner is where you go when you can't decide what to eat. Click the "Eat In" button if you want recipe suggestions and the "Eat Out" button if you would like to find local restaurants.

## Development Goals for this Web App:
---
1. Create a web application from scratch that solves a real world problem and uses data received from multiple API's requests. Github was used to create the repository for pull request and branches workflow.
2. Create a CSS framework using BULMA. Create a html page, JS page, and a results page.
3. Use API's from Zomato and Spoonacular.
4. Apply for API keys to Zomato and Spoonacular.
5. When using the app it asks multiple questions on what type of food, type of meal, eating at home or dining out. Then it will give you some results of how you answered the questions to help you chose what you are in the mood for to eat.
6. Use pull request and branches in github to upload the most current changes and check to see if all bugs were fixed.
7. Configure how to use Zomato and Spoonacular for our needs of the applicaton.
8. Utilize local storage to store the most recent search results as "Previous Suggestions."
9. Deploy application.
